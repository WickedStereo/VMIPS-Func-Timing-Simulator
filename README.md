This project is a tool for timing analysis of a VMIPS based Vector processor.

Usage:
Functional Simulator:
To run the functional simulator, enter <.\ak9327_am12553_funcsimulator.py --iodir C:\Users\anees\OneDrive\Documents\Pycharm\VMIPS\Functional_simulator\fclayer   
> in the terminal. Depending on the program, change the address to dotproduct or fclayer in the command.

Timing Simulator:
The resolved code gets output into the resolvedCode.txt file after running the Functional simulator.
Write the resolved code in the Code.txt file and configure parameters in config.txt as per the specification.
To use the simulator, run the main.py script in the terminal.
